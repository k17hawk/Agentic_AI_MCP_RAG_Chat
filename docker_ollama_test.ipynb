      "Let's delve into the fascinating world of Einstein's Theory of Relativity!  It's a complex but incredibly impactful theory. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Understanding the Basics:**\n",
      "\n",
      "At its heart, Einstein's Theory of Relativity revolves around two main postulates:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **The Principle of Relativity:** The laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion (constant speed). This means there's no absolute \"rest\" frame; your experience depends on how fast you're moving. \n",
      "2. **The Speed of Light is Constant:**  The speed of light in a vacuum (approximately 299,792,458 meters per second) is the same for all observers, regardless of their motion or the motion of the light source. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Relativity has two main versions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Special Relativity (1905):** Deals with objects moving at constant velocities, especially close to the speed of light. It breaks down a few core concepts:\n",
      "    * **Time Dilation:**  The passage of time is relative and slows down for objects in motion relative to a stationary observer. \n",
      "    * **Length Contraction:** The apparent length of an object also changes depending on its motion, appearing shorter when moving close to the speed of light.\n",
      "    * **Mass-Energy Equivalence (E=mc²):**  The famous equation showing that mass and energy are interchangeable – even a tiny amount of mass can be converted into a large amount of energy, as seen in nuclear reactions. \n",
      "\n",
      "* **General Relativity (1915):** Extends special relativity to include gravity! It describes how gravity is not a force but a curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of massive objects.  \n",
      "    * **Gravitational Time Dilation:** Time slows down in stronger gravitational fields. This means clocks tick slightly slower on Earth than in space (which has weaker gravity). \n",
      "    * **Light Bending:** Gravity bends the path of light, causing \"gravitational lensing.\"  We can even see this effect through images of distant stars and galaxies!\n",
      "\n",
      "**Consequences and Impact:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The theory of relativity revolutionized our understanding of the universe:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **GPS Technology:** Relativistic effects need to be accounted for in GPS satellites to ensure accurate timekeeping. \n",
      "* **Black Holes and Wormholes:** General relativity predicts the existence of black holes – regions of spacetime where gravity is so strong that not even light can escape. It also explains how wormholes, theoretical \"shortcuts\" through space and time, might exist (though their formation remains a mystery).  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Relativity shows us that there's no absolute frame of reference. \n",
      "* The speed of light is constant for everyone, meaning time itself changes depending on your velocity! \n",
      "* Gravity is not a force but a curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy.\n",

      "**Special Relativity: The Basics**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **The Speed of Light is Constant:** No matter how fast you move, light always travels at the same speed (approximately 299,792,458 meters per second) for all observers. This seems strange!\n",
      "* **Time Dilation:** Time isn't absolute; it actually *slows down* as you approach the speed of light. Imagine being in a spaceship zooming near the speed of light – time would seem to pass slower for you compared to someone on Earth. \n",
      "* **Length Contraction:** Objects appear shorter (contracted) when observed from a moving perspective. It's like your car racing past a stationary streetlight - it looks shorter as it goes by!\n",

      "\n",
      "* **Gravity Warps Spacetime:** Massive objects like stars and planets actually warp the fabric of space and time around them. Imagine a bowling ball on a trampoline – it creates a dip, right? That's what happens with gravity!\n",
      "* **Gravitational Time Dilation:** Time slows down in stronger gravitational fields. This means clocks run slower near massive objects than they do further away. \n",

Understanding the Basics: Decorator Anatomy**\\n\\n* **`@` symbol:** This magic prefix signals that you\\'re using a decorator, telling the interpreter to apply additional functionality (called the \"decorator\" function).\\n* **Inner Function (`wrapper`):**  This inner function acts as the actual enhanced version of the decorated function. It gets called instead of the original one, adding the extra features!\\n\\n**2. The Decorator Code: `my_decorator`** \\n\\n```python\\ndef my_decorator(func): # Define the decorator\\n    \"\"\"Log calls to decorated function.\"\"\"\\n    print(\"Calling function:\", func.__name__)  # Check which function is called\\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs): # Inner function (wrapper) definition \\n        result = func(*args, **kwargs) # Call the original function\\n        print(\"Function finished:\", func.__name__) \\n        return result # Return the result of the original function\\n    return wrapper # Return the wrapper function\\n```\\n\\n**Explanation:**\\n\\n* **`def my_decorator(func):`**: This defines our decorator, which takes another function (`func`) as its input.  This is where we\\'ll store the actual logic for applying changes to a function. \\n* **`print(\"Calling function:\", func.__name__)`**: The decorator prints the name of the function it\\'s about to wrap (useful for debugging).\\n* **`def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):`**:  We define `wrapper`.
